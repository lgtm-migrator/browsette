Browsette is an open source, community-driven browser extension to make your daily browsing easier than ever before.

Sounds boring. Let's try again.

__Browsette will not make you feel like using Stark's AI J.A.R.V.I.S. ...but you might feel like one.__

Once installed and configured, your browser will become the talk of the town _or your money back!_ With each website opened in your 
tab, you are to take the benefit of dozens of powerful addons and handy features. Friends will come up to you 
and ask, _"that is awesome! how do I get one?"_

At the end of the day, you'll begin to get the recognition, the one you have always felt you deserved. ...or at least you'll 
use the precious time you're saving by using Browsette to take care of your loved ones.
